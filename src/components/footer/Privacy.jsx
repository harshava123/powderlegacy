          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Cookie Policy</h2>
          <p>
            thepowderlegacy.in operates a strict privacy policy and we are committed to being transparent about how we use cookies on our website.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Why are cookies important?</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies help you make your online experience more efficient and relevant to your interests. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages efficiently.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is a Cookie?</h3>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small file, or files on your computer, phone, or other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference by the website you are visiting. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> – these are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – these usually have an expiration date and so stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them. For example we use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cookies are grouped into the following categories:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Essential</strong> – required for the regular operation of our websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional</strong> – remember your preferences to improve your experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong> – used for performance measurement to understand how many people visit our websites, how they navigate, and what content is popular.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising</strong> – enable us and partners to serve relevant advertisements on our sites and others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, you can see how Google Analytics uses cookie information by visiting <span className="break-all">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners. We also use third party information from third party sources to enable us deliver advertising. These sources are validated by third party providers.
