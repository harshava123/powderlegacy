## Data Storage

### How It Works:
- All admin changes are stored in **browser localStorage**
- Data is automatically synced between admin panel and frontend
- No database changes required for immediate updates

### Storage Keys:
- `admin_products` - Product data edited by admin
- `products_data` - Active products shown on frontend
- `admin_home_content` - Home page content
- `home_content` - Active home content
- `admin_header_content` - Header configuration
- `header_content` - Active header configuration
- `adminSession` - Admin authentication session

### Reset to Default:
Each content manager has a "Reset to Default" button that:
- Clears all admin edits
- Restores original content
- Requires page refresh

## Security

### Authentication:
- Admin login uses hardcoded credentials
- Session stored in localStorage
- Protected routes check authentication status
- Auto-redirect to login if not authenticated

### Session Management:
- Login creates admin session
- Session persists across page reloads
- Logout clears session and redirects to login

## Tips & Best Practices

### Products:
1. Always fill required fields (Name, Description)
2. Use high-quality image URLs
3. Keep sizes consistent across similar products
4. Update stock levels regularly
5. Maintain competitive pricing

### Content:
1. Keep hero text concise and impactful
2. Update testimonials with real customer feedback
3. Test navigation menu after changes
4. Use clear, action-oriented button text
5. Keep descriptions customer-focused

### Images:
1. Use absolute paths starting with `/` or full URLs
2. Optimize images for web (recommended: < 500KB)
3. Use consistent image dimensions per section
4. Test image URLs before saving

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Showing?
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
