Executive summary
- Overall routing/layout structure is sound. Cart context, filters, and checkout steps are implemented.
- Implemented key fixes: navigation improvements, legal pages/routes, SPA cart notification, CSS cleanup, and real product images. Remaining work: payment backend, header search wiring, favorites/details pages.

Implemented changes (since last report)
- Navigation & routing:
  * Converted About page navigation from <a> to SPA `Link` for no-reload navigation.
  * Added legal pages and routes: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/shipping` with provided content.
  * Registered auth routes: `/login`, `/signup` with basic forms.
- Cart & notifications:
  * Fixed missing `Shield` import in `Cart.jsx` and displayed item images when available.
  * Switched `CartNotification` navigation to SPA via `useNavigate` (removed `window.location.href`).
- Styling/config:
  * Removed default `#root` width/center constraints from `src/App.css` to allow full-width Tailwind layout.
- Product images:
  * Integrated real images from `src/components/*` folders in `Home.jsx` and `Products.jsx` using static imports.
  * Updated Products and Home cards to render images when present and fall back gracefully otherwise.

Routes and tabs tested
- Home (/)
- About and subsections (/about, /about/our-story, /about/manufacturing, /about/sustainability, /about/ingredients)
- Shop and categories (/shop, /shop/skin-care, /shop/hair-care, /shop/oral-care)
- Contact (/contact)
- Cart (/cart)
- Checkout (Address /checkout/address, Delivery /checkout/delivery, Payment /checkout/payment)
- Order success (/order-success)
- Account (/account) and Favorites (/favorites) placeholders
- Legal pages (/privacy, /terms, /shipping)
- Auth pages (/login, /signup)

Functional errors (previous vs now)
- [Fixed] Missing icon import in Cart page: `Shield` added.
- [Fixed] About nav used <a> causing reloads: replaced with `Link`.
- [New pages] Privacy/Terms/Shipping implemented and routed.
- [Open] Payment flow remains simulated and uses a Razorpay test key without backend order creation.

Broken navigation / 404s
- [Fixed] Footer links to /privacy, /terms, /shipping now resolve to implemented pages.

Placeholders and missing content
- [Improved] Product images now render from local assets where available.
- [Open] Favorites action remains a stub; “View Details” lacks product details route.
- [Open] Account and Favorites pages are placeholders.
- [Open] Shipping address not displayed/confirmed on Payment/Success pages.

UX and navigation
- [Improved] Cart notification uses SPA navigation for a smoother experience.
- [Open] Header search input (in Header) is visual-only; not wired to Products search/query.
- [Open] Active nav highlighting can be enhanced to highlight parent on nested routes.

Styling/config status
- Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` and `@import "tailwindcss"` confirmed working.
- Removed Vite’s default `#root` constraints to align with Tailwind sections/containers.
- Title and favicon are still generic (optional polish).

Configuration observations
- `react-router-dom` v7 usage is correct (Routes/Route/hooks).
- `razorpay` npm package is included but frontend uses the hosted script; keep only if a Node backend will create orders.

Data/state concerns
- Cart is in-memory; refresh will clear. Consider localStorage persistence/hydration.
- Checkout data in localStorage: `deliveryInfo` is read in Payment, but `shippingAddress` is not displayed/confirmed.

Security/privacy
- Razorpay test API key remains in client code; move to server/.env and create orders server-side before going live.
- PII (address/phone) is stored in localStorage; minimize retention and clear after order completion.

Recommendations (next actions)
- Payments:
  * Add a minimal backend API to create Razorpay orders and read API key from env; pass `order_id` to client.
- Product UX:
  * Implement a Product Details route (`/product/:id`) for “View Details” or remove the button for now.
  * Implement a Favorites context/page or hide the control until available.
- Search:
  * Wire header search to navigate to `/shop?q=...` and read the query param in Products to filter.
- Checkout:
  * Show and confirm shipping address on Payment and/or Success pages.
- Navigation polish:
  * Highlight parent nav on nested routes (e.g., pathname.startsWith('/about')).
- Branding:
  * Update `<title>` and favicon.

Quick checks per tab (current)
- Home: Renders; images show; Add to Cart works; CTAs navigate.
- About (+ subsections): SPA navigation; content switches by URL.
- Shop/categories: Filters/sort/view modes function; images show where available; favorites stub; details unimplemented.
- Contact: Form submits (simulated); social links OK.
- Cart: Quantity/remove work; summary correct; image rendering improved.
- Checkout Address: Saves to localStorage; proceeds to Payment.
- Checkout Delivery: Options save; totals include delivery fees; proceeds to Payment.
- Checkout Payment: UI fine; Razorpay flow still placeholder; clears cart on success handler.
- Order Success: Reads state; shows details if present.
- Account/Favorites: Placeholders.
- Privacy/Terms/Shipping: Pages render with provided content.

Configurable elements (where to edit)
- Header navigation links: src/components/header/Header.jsx
- Footer links: src/components/footer/Footer.jsx
- Product catalog/categories and sizes: src/components/pages/Products.jsx
- Delivery options: src/components/pages/CheckoutDelivery.jsx
- Payment methods/options: src/components/pages/CheckoutPayment.jsx
- Legal content: src/components/footer/{Privacy.jsx,Terms.jsx,Shipping.jsx}
