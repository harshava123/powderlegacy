rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /products/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can view
      allow write: if request.auth != null;  // Only authenticated
    }
    match /home/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /header/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Deploy rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage:rules
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Before Upload:**

1. **Optimize Images**
   - Compress to reduce file size
   - Tools: TinyPNG, Squoosh, ImageOptim
   - Target: < 500KB for best performance

2. **Resize Appropriately**
   - Product images: 800x800px (square)
   - Hero banners: 1920x600px (wide)
   - Category icons: 400x400px (square)

3. **Choose Right Format**
   - Photos → JPG (smaller)
   - Graphics/logos → PNG (transparent)
   - Modern browsers → WebP (best compression)

### **Naming Convention:**

Before uploading, rename files descriptively:
- ❌ `IMG_1234.jpg`
- ✅ `sassy-sunnipindi-front.jpg`

(Note: System will rename on upload, but this helps you organize)
